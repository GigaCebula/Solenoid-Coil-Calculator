# Solenoid-Coil-Calculator
A short MATLAB function calculating magnetic field parameters of an air-core solenoid coil using Biot-Savart law as a basis
Code generates a representation of a solenoid coil from given parameters: total length, core diameter, wire diameter, number of coils, layers. Then it generates a calculation space depending on user input:
